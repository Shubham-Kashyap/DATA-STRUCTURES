What is data structure ?

The ans is very simple ! The data structure is a way of organising and storing data on a computer so that it can be used effictively !
simple isn't it ?


example : suppose you have a bunch of books like the one that are present in library!
what you are gonna do next? organise and store it in a shack ! right ?!


This is what that datastructure does mean exactly!

now in technical terms ! think about how you can store it using a piece of code so that anyone can get,search, read, fetch details etc whenever they want 
that is when these terms come handy

so that you can get and read the book whenever you want 
so that you can get details of the book whenever you want when required

that the end of our example !
through these concepts you can store, organise and group the data during programming execution


 other single line example might be : 
 1. people waiting in a queue i.e waiting area of hospitals waiting for their turn to get checked by a doctor ( this can be managed through the software systems based on these Data Structures )
 2. people waiting in a line on a ticket window
 you can consider whatever example that pops up in your mind where you seems management and use as per the need
