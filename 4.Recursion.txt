what is recursion ?

A way of solving propblem having function calling itself !

How recursion works ??

-- performing the same operation again and again but with different params
-- every step we try smaller inputs to make problems smaller
-- base condition is needed to stop the recustion, otherwise infinite loop will 


python example :
did you ever see a doll within doll and there i another doll within that doll ? 
if yes then try executin that program 

program : 

def returnDollWithinDoll(dolls):
    if(dolls == 1):
        print("All dolls are opened !");
    else:
        returnDollWithinDoll(dolls - 1);
