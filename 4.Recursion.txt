what is recursion ?

A way of solving propblem having function calling itself !

How recursion works ??

-- performing the same operation again and again but with different params
-- every step we try smaller inputs to make problems smaller
-- base condition is needed to stop the recustion, otherwise infinite loop will 


python example :
did you ever see a doll within doll and there i another doll within that doll ? 
if yes then try executin that program 

program : 

def returnDollWithinDoll(dolls):
    if(dolls == 1):
        print("All dolls are opened !");
    else:
        returnDollWithinDoll(dolls - 1);


now this is the example showing a dummy program to get russian dolls (dolls hiding within a doll)

lets do another example :
you might have heard of a program to get the factorial of a number using recursion :
so, the program must be,



# program to print factorial of a number
def getFactorial(n):
    assert n < 0, "The number must be positive integer only";
    if(n == 1 or n == 0):
        retutn 1;
    else:
        return n * getFactorial(n-1):


# program to print fibonacci series
def getFibonacci(n):
    assert n<0, "The number must be a number";
    if(n in [0,1]):
        return 1;
    return getFibonacci(n-1) * getFibonacci(n-2)
